# How to run TitanTypes

***Recommended: Please use a standard computer screen/laptop, rather than a mobile device that has touch-screen abilities. This is because a keyboard will be needed to run the typing test, since keystrokes from a keyboard are pickup by our application***

If you are looking at our project through VSCode and also happen to have the Live Share/Live Server extension added, you can simply open our project by  right-clicking on our "index.html" file and selecting the "Open with Live Server".

Another option that we have provided for ease-of-use is to just click on the link that we have provided: (https:://titan-types.vercel.app/)

To begin after clicking the link or opening with Live Server, our web application will appear on your browser where you will be lead to our homepage. The typing test is contained within our homepage so this is what you will first see. Among the typing test, you will see "Home" and "About" on our navigation bar. If you would like, you may select the "About" option which will lead you to the page that contains information about our group. Otherwise, on the Home page, you will see two drop-down options. One of which, you may choose for the test to be 1 minute, 2 minutes, or 3 minutes in length. It is not mandatory to set as we do have it set to 1 minute by default. With the second drop-down option, you may choose whether to be tested with "Words" or "Quotes" but again, this is not mandatory as we do have it set to the quotes mode by default.

Once you have chosen all your personal testing preferences or decided to go with the default parameters that we have set for you, to start please ensure that you click on the page to make sure that it is in focus. Following, you will just begin typing along the prompt that follows on the screen. The first keystroke that you make will begin the timer countdown and you will see that the  accuracy and word count will change as you continue following along the test.

Your position will be recorded by a blinking line. Letters that you typed correctly will have a green backdrop, otherwise, if you happen to make a mistake then the incorrect entries will have a red backdrop. 

***Please note that typing more than two incorrect characters in a row will block you from making anymore errors. This is a feature that we added to protect the user from accidentally becoming off-track in their test and making too many consecutive mistakes.***

Once you have completed the test (the timer will countdown to 0), your test will finish, and then a pop-up window will display that will allow you to see how well you did on our test. This will show your cumulative statistics, such as your WPM, Words Typed, Characters Typed, Error Count, and Accuracy Percentage. Once you have examined your statistics, you can then exit out of this window and then the page will reload itself and you make continue retaking as many tests as you wish.
